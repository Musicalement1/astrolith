#Astrolith

Astrolith is a game simulating space physics in a universe generated randomly, but yet with coherent generation (such as random names, stars generating in a way that makes a random galaxy & more!)

For now, the game is a singleplayer sandbox where you can simply relax & visit brand new worlds :p

In the future, it may becomes a multiplayer game where people needs to use their ressources strategically to conquer whole systems.. or simply being so strong economically that everyone depends on you..
